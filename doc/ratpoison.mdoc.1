.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a Window Manager without fat library dependencies, fancy graphics or
rat dependence.
.Pp
The screen can be split into non-overlapping frames.
All windows are kept maximized inside their frames.
.Pp
All interaction with the window manager is done through
keystrokes.
.Nm
has a prefix map to minimize key clobbering.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Bs
.It Fl c , Fl \-command
Send ratpoison a command.
There must be a ratpoison instance running as window manager for the
given display/screen for this to work.
Do not forget to quote the command if it contains spaces.
For example:
.Dl Nm Fl c Qq Ar "echo hello world"
.It Fl d , Fl \-display Ar display
Set the X display to use or send commands to.
.It Fl f , Fl \-file Ar filename
Specify an alternate configuration file.
If this is not given,
.Nm
will try
.Pa $HOME/.ratpoisonrc
and if that does not exist
.Pa /etc/ratpoisonrc
and execute each command when starting up.
.It Fl h , Fl \-help
Show summary of options.
.It Fl i , Fl \-interactive
Execute commands given with
.Fl c
or
.Fl \-command
in interactive mode.
That means it will behave exactly as if called with
.Ic C\-t \&:
like prompting for missing arguments and things like that.
.It Fl s , Fl \-screen Ar number
Only use the specified screen.
.It Fl v , Fl \-version
Show version of program.
.El

If nothing is given, change it to the value of the environment variable
.Qq Ev HOME .
.It Ic clrunmanaged

current one.
(That means the next window belonging to another type of application
than the current one.)
.It Ic cprev
Like
.Ic prev
but switch to the previous window with another resource class than the
current one.
(That means the previous window belonging to another type of application

and pressing the key.
.It Ic dedicate Op Cm 0 | 1
Consider the current frame dedicated/chaste
.Pq Cm 1
or promiscuous
.Pq Cm 0 .
.Pp

frame instead.
.Pp
If no argument is given, toggle the current dedicateness.
By default no windows are dedicated.
.It Ic delete Pq Ic C\-t k
Close the current window.
.It Ic delkmap Ar keymap
Deletes the keymap named
.Ar keymap ,
that was generated with

in
.Li root
to
.Ar key ,
and
.Ic meta
binding in
.Li root
to
.Ar key
without modifiers or
.Ic "C\-" Ns Ar key
if
.Ar key
has no modifiers.
(If
.Ic set Ar topkmap
was called with an argument other than
.Ar top
that will be used instead of

.Ar shell\-command ,
showing _NET_WM_PID supporting programs in the given frame instead of
the frame selected when this program is run.

wide, depending whether there is
.Ql \-

.Ic addhook
to be executed when even
.Ar event
occurs.
.It Ic meta Oo Ar key Oc Pq Ic C\-t t
Send the escape key (that which normally is
.Ic C\-t )
to the current window.
If a
.Ar key
is specified, this is sent instead.
Note that some applications by default ignore the synthetic key that is
sent using this command as it is considered a security hole.
xterm is one such application.
.It Ic msgwait Op Ar seconds
Set the duration the message window is shown.
If
.Ar seconds
is zero, wait infinitely.
This command is deprecated, please set the
.Va msgwait
variable instead.

user has made.
Note that this command probably does not make much sense in interactive
mode.
.It Ic putsel Ar x\-selection

.Ar x\-selection .
It can be inserted into the current window with
.Ic getsel .
.It Ic quit
Quit
.Nm .

in
.Ar keymap .
To show it is waiting for a key,
.Nm
will change the rat cursor to a square if
.Va waitcursor
is set.
This command is perhaps best described with its usage in the default
configuration: by pressing
.Ic C\-t ,
which is the only key in the keymap
top ,
the command
.Qq Ic readkey Ar root
is executed.
The next key then executes the command in keymap
.Li root
belonging to
this command.
.It Ic redisplay Pq Ic C\-t l
Extend the current window to the whole size of its current frame and
redisplay it.
(Useful to redisplay normal windows or bring transient windows to the
